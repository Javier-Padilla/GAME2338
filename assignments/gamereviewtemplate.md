### Rating

Rating this game on my scale of 1 through 7, I would give this game a 4 out of 7. Still good, but expect some major hiccups to overcome and get used too. 

## Summary

  This game takes place in the Fallout universe and places you as "The Vault Dweller", an unfortante soul tasked with saving everyone within their vault. One day, as you go about your tasks within the vault, you are told by your overseer that the water chip allowing everyone to have clean water has broke. With this chip broken and no spare pieces left in the vault, you have been choosen to venture forward into the post apocolyptic land of southern California in order to find another water chip and save everyone. 

  As you journey and find allies in the neighboring civilizations built up from the ashes of society you find a bigger fish to fry. Mutants of the wasteland have been spotted and are insanely hostile, but what is creating these beings of vast destruction and how can you stop it? These problems that seem bigger than you are only amplified when you realize that you only have 121 in game days to find the water chip- otherwise everyone in the vault will die of dehydration.
  
  The Vault Dweller finds themself as a fish out of water stuck between dehydration and an overwhelming force of mutants. Load your pistol, check your pip-boy often, and make as many allies as you can to aid you in your fight. While circumstances may change and the enemies may vary in form, war never changes. 

## Final Thoughts

Before I get into the review, it is important to understand that this is a isometric roleplaying game and I will hold it to the same standards that I hold every roleplaying game I play.

When reviewing this game that was created and published in 1997, you can only expect so much. Though a lot of this game is very well put together- it still suffers from the problems of past. The absolute biggest problem is the horrid usability. The controls, functions, and mechanics of this game are very dated and requires you to watch a thirty minute guide on how to even make your character and play. If you would go into this game blind with no idea of how to play it or what anything meant, you would not be able to get out of the tutorial area. Things such as switching weapons were not clear to until five hours in. Things like inventory management were not clear to me until three hours in. These are things that you will do often within Fallout and the fact that it takes so much to learn how to do it and what everything even means is not okay. IF this game was released with the same user interface and intro today, it would be a laughing stock, luckily it is protected by the passing of time.

The combat is another winkle on the game that shows its age more than anything else. The combat within Fallout is turned based and opperates off of an action point system that can be boosted if you have high agility. More agility equals more actions. However the play out of combat consists of clicking and then waiting. The correctness of combat does not meet the requirements that I expect when playing any turn based game. All you do is click who you want to attack, a little animation plays and then it is the enemies turn. It goes like that back and forth until someone dies and usually it is you. The game has an insane difficulty factor to it, all enemies hit so hard and if you do not build your character a certain way, you will not have fun playing the game. This ties back the usability part where you literally need a guide in order to even have fun. This shows a huge flaw in the roleplaying aspect of the game as you cannot build whoever you want to have fun. You need high agiligty and endurance otherwise you will not even have fun.

These things knock off huge points for the game for me and they would be enough to sink it for most people but as usual, the characters, story, and dialouge save and carry the game enough that I actaully finish it despite having a horrible first fifteen hours. The civilizations and towns that you meet are so realized and full with character and personality, so much so that this game sets the bar for how the tone of Fallout should be and strive to be. That may sound obvious that the first entry into a series should set the tone for games coming forward, but look at Banjoo Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts or Golden Eye 007 Reloaded. The doom and gloom is palpable only to be uplifted by theatrical characters with their dated but oddly charming animations. The voices given to the characters ooze personality, sleezy merchants have that gutteral talk that carries speed in their tone. Characters like Herald talk with a creak in their voice as if each word is blowing dust off of their vocal chords. Allowing yourself to get swept up in the world and characters is one of the best things you can do within the Fallout franchise in general and this game is no different. The writers knew what defined a RPG system when it came to dailouge and characters, one of the biggest testiments to that being the fact that you can talk and debate a big bad character instead of fighting them. It just makes me wish that this game had smoke tested the core elements of the game so that everything could have risen to reach the world they built.
