# Types of Testing

---

# Agenda

* Look at various types of testing

---

# Core Types Of Testing (People) 

---

## WHITE BOX TESTING
* Testing based on an analysis of internal workings, logic and structure of a piece of software. 
* Includes techniques such as testing a branch of code.
* This is usually considered in house testing by developers or employees of the company.

## BLACK BOX TESTING
* Testing without knowledge of the internal workings of the item being tested. 
* Testing from a userâ€™s perspective.
* Tests are usually functional.
* This is usually considered outside of the company testing; alpha and beta tests are examples.

---

# Core Modes of Testing (Process)

---

# ACCEPTANCE TESTING

* Testing to verify a product meets customer specified requirements.
* customer usually does this type of testing on a product that is developed externally.

---

# AUTOMATED TESTING

* Utilizing a test tool to automate testing.
* Reduces the testing time but requires maintenance and knowledge of the tool by a QA tester.

---

# COMPATIBILITY TESTING
* Testing to ensure compatibility of an application or Web site with different browsers, OSs, and hardware platforms. Compatibility testing can be performed manually or can be driven by an automated functional or regression test suite.
* Considered important to make sure the software behaves the same across different devices.

---

# CONFORMANCE TESTING

* Verifying implementation conformance to industry standards such as 508.
* Testing for quality factors such as portability, interoperability, and/or compatibility a standard defines.
* Looks to make sure it meets accessibility requirements and/or federal, state, or local laws.

---

# FUNCTIONAL TESTING
* Validating an application/software/web site meets its specifications and correctly performs all its required functions.
* This entails a series of tests which perform a feature by feature validation of behavior, using a wide range of normal and erroneous input data. This can involve testing of the product's user interface, APIs, database management, security, installation, networking, etc.
* Testing can be performed on an automated or manual basis using black box or white box methodologies.
* This is the most common form of testing. As you are making sure "functionality" exists for a given product.

---

# INTEGRATION TESTING

* Testing in which modules are combined and tested as a group.
* Modules are typically code modules, individual applications, client and server applications on a network, etc. 
* Integration Testing follows unit testing and precedes system testing.
* Testing that occurs after several parts are complete and they needed to be tested end to end.

---

# LOAD TESTING
* Load testing is a generic term covering Performance Testing and Stress Testing.

---

# NEGATIVE TESTING

* Validating an application/software/web site to validate error conditions
* Does it behave like I expect it to when I attempt to break the piece of software of code.

---

# PERFORMANCE TESTING
* Performance testing can be applied to understand your application or WWW site's scalability, or to benchmark the performance in an environment of third party products such as servers and middleware for potential purchase.
* This sort of testing is particularly useful to identify performance bottlenecks in high use applications.
* Performance testing generally involves an automated test suite as this allows easy simulation of a variety of normal, peak, and exceptional load conditions.
* How much resources does the program use with normal operations.

---

# SMOKE TESTING
* A quick-and-dirty test that the major functions of a piece of software work without bothering with finer details.
* This testing is usually done right after a new build is received into a new test environment.
* Testing one line of logic just built. Not testing other parts of the system just the one with the change.
* Considered high risk because other parts could be affected by the change.
      
* Examples of risk with smoke testing

---

# STRESS TESTING

* Testing conducted to evaluate a system or component at or beyond the limits of its specified requirements to determine the load under which it fails and how. 
* A graceful degradation under load leading to non-catastrophic failure is the desired result. 
* Often Stress Testing is performed using the same process as Performance Testing but employing a very high level of simulated load.
* Used to answer the important question of at which point will my program break.

---

# REGRESSION TESTING

* Similar in scope to a functional test, a regression test allows a consistent, repeatable validation of each new release of a product. 
* Such testing ensures reported product defects have been corrected for each new release and that no new quality problems were introduced in the maintenance process. 
* Though regression testing can be performed manually an automated test suite is often used to reduce the time and resources needed to perform the required testing.
* As new functions are added you continue to do all the existing functional tests in a process called regression testing to make sure new features don't break existing tested functionality of the code.
* You repeat all the existing functional testing until everything passes.

---

# SYSTEM TESTING

* Testing conducted on a complete, integrated system to evaluate the system's compliance with its specified requirements.
* System testing falls within the scope of black box testing, and as such, should require no knowledge of the inner design of the code or logic.
      

---

# UNIT TESTING
* Functional and reliability testing in an development environment.
* Producing tests for the behavior of components of a product to ensure their correct behavior prior to system integration.
* This testing is usually conducted by the developer or development team.
* Testing a unit or section (usually a specific function) within the code.

---

# TYPES OF GAME TESTING
      
---
      
# BALANCE TESTING

* Testing to verify that gameplay is fair to both the human versus AI player, and single and multiplayer modes. 
* Making sure easy level is not too easy and hard level is not too hard.
* Examples are testing weapons balance, and map balance.

---

# COMPATIBILITY TESTING

* Same as above only on a game.

---

# COMPLIANCE TESTING

* Testing to verify games follows some established guidelines before it is allowed to be sold in stores.
* Common compliance requirements are copyrighted brands and names are accompanied by their respective signs and certain warning message in regards to the memory card/hard drive formatting.

---      

# LOCALIZATION TESTING

* Testing to verify a game can be converted from one region to another usually involves translation.
* The same game can be played in US, Korea, Japan or Germany.

---

# PLAYTESTING

* Comparable to a user acceptance test with users from the general public.
* Determining the fun factor, is the game entertaining and fun to play.

---

# USABILITY TESTING

* Testing to verify the game is easy to use. Not easy as in difficulty level.
* The game is intuitive meaning user can figure out how to interact with other characters, how to aim, how to find your way and how to drive vehicles.
